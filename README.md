# 🦽 Voice-Controlled Virtual Wheelchair

This project demonstrates a **Voice-Controlled Virtual Wheelchair**, designed to help individuals with mobility challenges navigate using voice commands. It simulates a real-world wheelchair using voice control in a 3D browser environment, offering a hands-free, immersive, and accessible interaction experience.

Although it's currently virtual, this concept showcases how smart technologies can inspire the development of real-world, voice-operated mobility aids, enhancing independence and quality of life.

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- 🎙️ **Voice-Controlled Navigation**  
- 🌐 **Multi-language Feedback**: English, Hindi, Telugu  
- 🛞 **3D Simulation using GLTF/GLB Models**  
- 💻 **No installation needed**: Works directly in modern browsers  
- 🔁 **Supports momentary and continuous commands**

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Provide a **safe, low-cost** virtual prototype for real-world applications.
- Raise awareness of **assistive voice technologies**.
- Enable **multi-language interaction** for inclusive access.
- Serve as an **educational tool** to demonstrate AI + accessibility integration.

## 🛠 Features

- 🎤 Voice-controlled movement: `go`, `stop`, `turn left`, `turn right`
- 🌍 Multi-language feedback: English, Hindi, Telugu
- 🧑‍🦽 Realistic 3D wheelchair simulation (GLTF/GLB)
- 🔄 Momentary & continuous command support
- ♿ Accessible UI for people with physical impairments
- 🗺️ Language-specific command mapping

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a **modern browser** (preferably Chrome).
3. **Allow microphone access** when prompted.
4. Speak supported voice commands.

📌 Important Note:
To ensure 3D models load properly, open `index.html` using **Live Server in VS Code** or any other local server. Directly opening via file system (`file://`) may prevent the model from loading due to browser security restrictions.


### 🎙️ Sample Voice Commands

| Action               | English        | Hindi          | Telugu          |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Stop                 | "Stop"         | "रुको"         | "ఆపు"           |
| Move Forward         | "Go forward"   | "आगे बढ़ो"     | "ముందుకు పో"    |
| Move Forward (cont.) | "Keep going"   | "चलते रहो"     | "ముందుకు వెళ్లు"|
| Turn Left            | "Turn left"    | "बाएं मुड़ो"    | "ఎడమకు తిప్పు"   |
